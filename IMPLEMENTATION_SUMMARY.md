# Test Session Interface Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the test session interface in the medical preparation application, focusing on enhanced user experience and mobile responsiveness.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Clickable Table Rows in Test History
**Location**: `components/test/user-progress-dashboard.tsx`
- Made entire table rows clickable to navigate to test results
- Added hover effects and cursor pointer for better UX
- Maintained the View button for desktop while adding row-level navigation
- Prevented event propagation conflicts between row clicks and button clicks

### 2. Mobile-Responsive View Column
**Location**: `components/test/user-progress-dashboard.tsx`
- Hidden the "View" column on mobile and small screens using `hidden sm:table-cell`
- Users can now tap anywhere on the row to view results on mobile devices
- Maintains desktop functionality while optimizing for mobile UX

### 3. Enhanced Test Session Naming
**Locations**: 
- `components/test/enhanced-create-test-interface.tsx`
- `components/test/create-test-interface.tsx`

**Improvements**:
- More contextual naming based on filters and session mode
- Medical specialty abbreviations (e.g., "CARD" for Cardiology, "GI" for Gastroenterology)
- Year abbreviations (e.g., "19" for 2019)
- Exam type integration (e.g., "USMLE", "COMLEX")
- Difficulty level indicators (e.g., "L3" or "L1-3")
- Session counter for uniqueness
- Format examples:
  - `Exam-COC-19-02` (COC exam from 2019, session 2)
  - `Practice-CARD-L3-15` (Cardiology practice, level 3, session 15)

### 4. Enhanced Notes Panel
**Locations**:
- `app/api/user/notes/route.ts`
- `components/test/user-progress-dashboard.tsx`

**Features**:
- Collapsible question details with expand/collapse functionality
- Full question text display when expanded
- Complete answer choices with correct answer highlighting
- Explanation and sources sections
- Visual indicators for correct answers
- Improved data structure to include full question details

### 5. Improved Question Review Section
**Locations**:
- `app/api/sessions/[sessionId]/results/route.ts`
- `components/test/test-results.tsx`

**Enhancements**:
- Full question text display in expanded view
- Answer choices shown with full text instead of just letters
- Color-coded answer options (green for correct, red for user's incorrect choice)
- Option text display in format "A. [Full option text]" instead of just "A"
- Added explanation and sources sections
- Better visual hierarchy and spacing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure Changes
