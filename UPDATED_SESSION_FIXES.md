# Updated Test Session Fixes - Per User Requirements

## Changes Made ✅

### 1. Removed "Resume Test Session" Popup Completely
- **Removed session recovery prompt dialog** from `enhanced-create-test-interface.tsx`
- **Eliminated all recovery popup functionality** - no more intrusive dialogs
- **Session recovery now handled entirely through the Active Session Card** which is cleaner and less disruptive

### 2. Fixed Pause Behavior - Now Saves Session Data
- **Modified pause functionality** to keep session data for resuming
- **Removed localStorage clearing** on pause - session data is preserved
- **Keep active_session_id in user profile** so paused sessions remain "active" for resuming
- **Modified active session API** to include paused sessions for resuming
- **User can now pause and resume sessions seamlessly** through the Active Session Card

### 3. Restored All Header Buttons in Mobile View
- **Reverted mobile header changes** - all buttons now visible on mobile like before
- **Removed mobile menu/sidebar grouping** for header buttons
- **All tool buttons (Flag, Lab Values, Notes, Theme, Calculator) visible on all screen sizes**
- **Consistent button layout** across desktop and mobile

### 4. Moved Pause Button to Footer
- **Added pause button to footer** next to the "End Block" button
- **Styled as outline button** with yellow accent to distinguish from destructive "End Block"
- **Shows "Pause" text on desktop, icon only on mobile** for space efficiency
- **Maintains confirmation dialog** before pausing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Session Management Changes:
```typescript
// Pause now preserves session data
const handlePauseSession = async () => {
  // Keep session data in localStorage for resuming later
  // Don't clear it - we want the active session to show up
  router.push('/')
}
```

### API Changes:
```typescript
// Active session API now includes paused sessions
.eq("is_active", true) // Only return if session is still active
// Include paused sessions so they can be resumed
```

### UI Layout Changes:
- **Header**: All buttons visible on mobile (Flag, Lab Values, Notes, Theme, Calculator)
- **Footer**: Added Pause button next to End Block button
- **No more mobile menu** for header tools - everything accessible directly

## User Experience Improvements

### Seamless Session Management:
1. **Start a test session**
2. **Click "Pause" in footer** → Confirms and navigates to home
3. **See "Active Session Card"** on homepage with resume option
4. **Click "Resume Test Session"** → Continue exactly where you left off
5. **No popups or interruptions** - clean workflow

### Mobile-Friendly Interface:
