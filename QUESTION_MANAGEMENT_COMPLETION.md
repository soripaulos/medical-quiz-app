## ðŸ“‹ Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- âœ… TypeScript compilation (no errors)
- âœ… Next.js 15 compatibility (build successful)
- âœ… Component integration
- âœ… API route functionality
- âœ… Modal behavior
- âœ… Form validation
- âœ… Image upload handling
- âœ… Data filtering and searching

## ðŸ”§ Build Fix Applied

**Issue**: Next.js 15 changed the API route parameter structure from `{ params: { id: string } }` to `{ params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`.

**Solution**: Updated all API route handlers in `/api/admin/questions/[id]/route.ts` to use the new async parameter structure:

```typescript
// Before (Next.js 14)
export async function GET(req: Request, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  // ...
}

// After (Next.js 15)
export async function GET(req: Request, context: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  const { id } = await context.params
  // ...
}
```

This fix ensures compatibility with Next.js 15 and resolves the build error encountered during deployment.

## ðŸ”„ Future Enhancements

The system is now ready for production use. Potential future improvements could include:
- Bulk operations (delete multiple questions)
- Question duplication
- Advanced search with multiple criteria
- Export/import functionality
- Question preview in quiz format
- Audit trail for question changes
