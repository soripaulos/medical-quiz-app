# React Error #185 Fix - Infinite Loop Resolution

## Problem Description
The application was experiencing a React minified error #185 on the homepage when logged in. This error corresponds to "Maximum update depth exceeded" which indicates an infinite loop in component updates.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was located in `components/test/enhanced-create-test-interface.tsx` in the following `useEffect`:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  generateSessionName()
}, [filters, sessionMode, sessionName])  // ❌ sessionName in dependencies caused infinite loop
```

### The Infinite Loop Cycle:
1. `useEffect` runs when `sessionName` changes
2. `generateSessionName()` is called
3. `setSessionName(name)` is called inside `generateSessionName()`
4. `sessionName` state changes, triggering the `useEffect` again
5. Loop continues indefinitely, causing React to throw error #185

## Solution Applied
Removed `sessionName` from the `useEffect` dependencies array:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  generateSessionName()
}, [filters, sessionMode])  // ✅ Fixed: removed sessionName from dependencies
```

## Why This Fix Works
- The `useEffect` now only runs when `filters` or `sessionMode` change, which is the intended behavior
- `sessionName` is no longer a dependency, so changing it doesn't trigger the effect
- The session name generation logic still works correctly for the intended use cases
- The infinite loop is broken, preventing the React error #185

## Files Modified
- `components/test/enhanced-create-test-interface.tsx` - Fixed the infinite loop

## Testing
- Application builds successfully without errors
- No compilation issues
- The fix maintains the intended functionality while preventing the infinite loop

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Be careful when including state variables in `useEffect` dependencies that are modified within the effect
2. Consider if the state variable is truly needed as a dependency
3. Use React's development build locally to catch these errors early with clearer error messages
4. Review `useEffect` dependencies carefully during code reviews
