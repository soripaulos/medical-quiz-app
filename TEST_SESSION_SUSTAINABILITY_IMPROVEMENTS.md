# Test Session Sustainability Improvements

## Overview
The test session pages were experiencing frequent reloads and unexpected closures, especially when switching tabs or applications. This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to ensure test sessions remain sustained and recoverable.

## 🔧 **Key Issues Identified**

1. **Aggressive Session Management**: The original implementation was too aggressive in pausing sessions on tab switches
2. **Unnecessary Session Cleanup**: Sessions were being cleaned up too frequently (every 1 hour)
3. **No Recovery Mechanism**: No way to recover from unexpected page reloads or closures
4. **BeforeUnload Interference**: Aggressive beforeunload handling was causing issues

## ✅ **Improvements Implemented**

### 1. **Less Aggressive Visibility Handling**
**File**: `components/quiz/quiz-interface.tsx`

**Before**:
- Paused session immediately on tab switch
- Resumed session on tab focus
- Aggressive beforeunload handling

**After**:
- Only updates last activity time on tab switch (doesn't pause)
- Ensures session is active on tab focus
- BeforeUnload only shows warning for active sessions
- Minimal cleanup on component unmount

### 2. **Periodic Session Heartbeat**
**File**: `components/quiz/quiz-interface.tsx`

**Added**:
- Heartbeat every 30 seconds to update `last_activity_at`
- Prevents session from being marked as orphaned
- Keeps session alive during long test sessions

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const heartbeatInterval = setInterval(async () => {
    try {
      await fetch(`/api/sessions/${session.id}/active-time`, {
        method: "POST",
      })
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error sending session heartbeat:", error)
    }
  }, 30000) // Send heartbeat every 30 seconds

  return () => {
    clearInterval(heartbeatInterval)
  }
}, [session.id])
```

### 3. **Extended Session Cleanup Window**
**File**: `lib/session-utils.ts`

**Before**:
- Cleaned up sessions inactive for 1 hour
- Immediate cleanup without verification

**After**:
- Extended cleanup window to 6 hours
- Double verification before cleanup
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 4. **Session Recovery System**
**Files**: 
- `components/test/test-session.tsx`
- `components/test/enhanced-create-test-interface.tsx`

**Added**:
- localStorage persistence of active session data
- Recovery prompt on homepage when active session detected
- Automatic cleanup when session properly ends

**Features**:
- Stores session ID, name, start time, and URL
- Shows recovery prompt for sessions less than 24 hours old
- Allows users to resume or start new test

### 5. **Smart Session Cleanup Prevention**
**File**: `components/test/user-progress-dashboard.tsx`

**Before**:
- Always called session cleanup on dashboard load

**After**:
- Only calls cleanup if no active session in localStorage
- Prevents cleanup of currently active sessions

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### Session Persistence Flow:
1. **Session Start**: Session data stored in localStorage
2. **Heartbeat**: Every 30 seconds, session activity updated
3. **Tab Switch**: Only activity time updated, session stays active
4. **Recovery**: If user navigates away and returns, recovery prompt shown
5. **Clean End**: localStorage cleared when session properly ends

### Recovery Flow:
1. User lands on homepage
2. System checks localStorage for active session
3. If found and recent (< 24 hours), shows recovery prompt
4. User can resume session or start new test

## 📊 **Benefits**

1. **Sustained Sessions**: Test sessions no longer close unexpectedly
2. **Tab-Switch Safe**: Users can switch tabs without losing progress
3. **Recovery Support**: Users can recover from accidental page closes
4. **Better UX**: No more lost progress or unexpected redirects
5. **Debugging**: Better logging for troubleshooting

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### Session Heartbeat
- **Frequency**: Every 30 seconds
- **Endpoint**: `/api/sessions/${sessionId}/active-time`
- **Purpose**: Update `last_activity_at` to prevent cleanup

### Recovery Data Structure
```typescript
{
  sessionId: string,
  sessionName: string,
  startTime: number,
  url: string
}
```

### Cleanup Thresholds
- **Old System**: 1 hour inactivity
- **New System**: 6 hours inactivity with double verification

## 🛡️ **Safety Measures**

1. **Graceful Degradation**: If localStorage fails, session continues normally
2. **Error Handling**: All network operations have try-catch blocks
3. **Cleanup Safety**: Multiple checks before cleaning up sessions
4. **User Control**: Users can always dismiss recovery prompts

## 📝 **Usage Notes**

### For Users:
- Test sessions now stay active when switching tabs
- If you accidentally close the browser, you can recover your session
- Sessions automatically clean up after 6 hours of inactivity

### For Developers:
- Session persistence is automatic
- Recovery prompts appear automatically
- All changes are backward compatible
- Extensive logging for debugging

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. **Auto-save Progress**: Save answers to localStorage as backup
2. **Session Sync**: Sync session state across multiple tabs
3. **Offline Support**: Allow sessions to work offline
4. **Session Transfer**: Transfer sessions between devices
5. **Advanced Recovery**: Recover partial progress even if session ends

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Test sessions are now fully sustained and recoverable.
