# Homepage Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Question Count Issue - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: Homepage was showing only 1000 questions when there were more in the database.

**Root Cause**: The filtered questions API was returning the count of the filtered/returned questions rather than the total count of questions matching the base filters.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `/app/api/questions/filtered/route.ts` to perform a separate count query before applying pagination
- Now returns the total count from the database query for questions matching the base filters (specialty, exam type, year, difficulty)
- Only uses the filtered count when question status filtering is applied (since that filtering happens in JavaScript)

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Get the total count of questions matching the filters (before question status filtering)
const { count: totalCount, error: countError } = await countQuery

// Return the total count from the database query, not the filtered count
const finalCount = filters.questionStatus && filters.questionStatus.length > 0 
  ? filteredQuestions.length  // If status filtering is applied, use the filtered count
  : totalCount || 0           // Otherwise, use the total count from the database
```

### 2. Years Issue - IMPROVED ✅

**Problem**: Only showing 2023, 2024, 2025 but there were more years in the database.

**Root Cause**: The years API had a fallback method with a limit of 10,000 which might not be sufficient, and the RPC function might not exist.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the limit from the fallback query in `/app/api/questions/years/route.ts`
- Added better error handling and method indication
- The API now tries the RPC function first, then falls back to a direct query without limits

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Use a direct query to get distinct years without any limit
const { data: questions, error: fallbackError } = await supabase
  .from("questions")
  .select("year")
  .not("year", "is", null)
  .order("year", { ascending: false }) // Removed .limit(10000)
```

### 3. Mobile Layout Issue - FIXED ✅

**Problem**: In mobile view, the order should be Question Filters → Test Configuration → Quick Stats.

**Root Cause**: The CSS Grid ordering was not properly configured for mobile vs desktop layouts.

**Solution**: 
- Restructured the layout in `/components/test/enhanced-create-test-interface.tsx`
- Used CSS Grid ordering to ensure proper mobile sequence
- Created separate Quick Stats cards for mobile and desktop to avoid duplication issues

**Mobile Layout (order-1, order-2, order-3)**:
1. Question Filters (order-1, spans full width)
2. Test Configuration (order-2, includes Active Session Card)
3. Quick Stats (order-3, mobile-only card)

**Desktop Layout (lg:order-1, lg:order-2)**:
1. Question Filters (lg:order-1, spans 2 columns)
2. Right Column (lg:order-2, contains Test Configuration + Quick Stats stacked)

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Question Filters - First in mobile, spans 2 columns in desktop
<Card className="lg:col-span-2 order-1 lg:order-1">

// Test Configuration - Second in mobile, grouped with Quick Stats in desktop  
<div className="space-y-6 order-2 lg:order-2 lg:col-span-1">

// Quick Stats - Hidden on mobile, shown in desktop as part of right column
<Card className="hidden lg:block">

// Quick Stats - Third in mobile, hidden in desktop
<Card className="lg:hidden order-3">
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Question Count**: 
   - Check that the homepage now shows the correct total number of questions
   - Verify that filtering still works correctly
   - Test with and without question status filters

2. **Years**: 
   - Verify that all available years from the database are now shown
   - Check that the years are sorted in descending order (newest first)

3. **Mobile Layout**: 
   - Test on mobile/narrow screen widths
   - Verify the order is: Question Filters → Test Configuration → Quick Stats
   - Test on desktop to ensure the layout still works properly

## Additional Improvements Made

- Better error handling in the years API
- More efficient count query in the filtered questions API
- Cleaner mobile/desktop responsive design
- Proper CSS Grid ordering for different screen sizes
