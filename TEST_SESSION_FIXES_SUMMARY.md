# Test Session Stability Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Timer Reset Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Timer in question interface was resetting at certain times and not counting consistently.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Removed `timeRemaining` from timer effect dependencies to prevent resets
- Improved timer stability by using refs to manage intervals
- Reduced active time polling from every 1 second to every 5 seconds for better performance
- Added proper cleanup of timer intervals
- Separated exam countdown timer from practice stopwatch logic

### 2. Missing Pause Button ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: No pause button available in the question interface.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added pause button to the quiz interface header with pause icon
- Added pause confirmation dialog with clear messaging
- Implemented proper pause functionality that:
  - Pauses the session on the server
  - Clears localStorage to prevent popup issues
  - Navigates back to homepage
  - Handles errors gracefully

### 3. Stubborn Active Session Popup ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Active session popup was unavoidable and appeared even after pausing/ending sessions.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Modified active session API to exclude paused sessions
- Enhanced pause API to clear active session from user profile
- Improved session recovery to be less aggressive (4 hours instead of 24)
- Added server-side verification for session recovery
- Proper localStorage cleanup in all session end/pause scenarios

### 4. Submission and Results Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Submitting results when session is complete didn't properly submit answers and generate results.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Enhanced session ending process to properly set completion status
- Improved metrics calculation and storage
- Better error handling in session end API
- Ensured navigation to results even if API calls fail
- Enhanced results API to handle edge cases

### 5. Mobile View Improvements ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Features were unstable on mobile view with poor responsiveness.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Responsive header design with primary actions always visible
- Secondary actions accessible via mobile menu
- Mobile-friendly footer with compact navigation
- Better touch targets and organized tool access

### 6. Session Activity Tracking Improvements ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Overly aggressive session tracking causing instability.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Less aggressive visibility change handling
- Improved heartbeat system with 30-second intervals
- Better session state management
- Reduced false positives for session cleanup
