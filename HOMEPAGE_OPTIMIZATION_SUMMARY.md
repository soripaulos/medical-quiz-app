# Homepage Question Loading Optimizations

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **1000 Question Limit Issue**
**Problem**: Supabase has a default limit of 1000 rows for queries, which was limiting the number of questions loaded on the homepage.

**Solution**: 
- Added explicit `limit` parameter to API calls with a default of 5000 questions
- Added `range()` method to Supabase queries to override the default limit
- Added pagination support with `offset` parameter for future scalability
- Added `hasMore` indicator to track if more questions are available

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/questions/filtered/route.ts`
- `components/test/enhanced-create-test-interface.tsx`

### 2. **Years Fetching Optimization**
**Problem**: Years were being fetched by loading all question records and then extracting unique years, which was inefficient and subject to the 1000 row limit.

**Solution**:
- Created a database function `get_distinct_years()` for efficient year fetching
- Added fallback method for backward compatibility
- Added database index on the `year` column for better performance
- Increased limit to 10000 for fallback method to ensure all years are fetched

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/questions/years/route.ts`
- `scripts/15-optimize-years-query.sql` (new)

### 3. **Improved Question Randomization**
**Problem**: Basic randomization using `Math.random() - 0.5` was not ensuring proper distribution across specialties, leading to repeated groups of questions from the same specialty.

**Solution**:
- Implemented specialty-aware randomization algorithm
- Groups questions by specialty first
- Shuffles questions within each specialty
- Interleaves questions from different specialties for better distribution
- Shuffles specialty order for each round to avoid patterns

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/questions/filtered/route.ts`

### 4. **Performance Improvements**
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive database indexes for filtering columns
- Added composite index for common filter combinations
- Added indexes for user progress and answers queries
- Added `ANALYZE` statements to update query statistics

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/16-add-performance-indexes.sql` (new)

### 5. **User Experience Improvements**
**Solution**:
- Added loading spinner with "Loading..." text for question count
- Added number formatting with `toLocaleString()` for better readability
- Added console logging when more questions might be available
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms

**Files Modified**:
- `components/test/enhanced-create-test-interface.tsx`

## Database Scripts to Run

You need to run these SQL scripts in your Supabase database:

1. **`scripts/15-optimize-years-query.sql`**
   - Creates the `get_distinct_years()` function
   - Adds index on the `year` column
   - Grants permissions to authenticated users

2. **`scripts/16-add-performance-indexes.sql`**
   - Adds performance indexes for all filtering columns
   - Creates composite indexes for common queries
   - Analyzes tables for better query planning

## Expected Results

After implementing these optimizations:

1. **More Questions**: The homepage will now load up to 5000 questions instead of being limited to 1000
2. **All Years**: All years from the database will be properly displayed in the years filter
3. **Better Distribution**: Questions will be properly randomized across specialties, reducing repetition
4. **Faster Loading**: Database indexes will improve query performance
5. **Better UX**: Users will see loading indicators and properly formatted numbers

## API Changes

### `/api/questions/filtered` (POST)
**New Parameters**:
- `limit` (optional, default: 5000): Maximum number of questions to return
- `offset` (optional, default: 0): Number of questions to skip for pagination

**New Response Fields**:
- `hasMore`: Boolean indicating if more questions are available
- `offset`: Current offset used
- `limit`: Current limit used

### `/api/questions/years` (GET)
**New Response Fields**:
- `count`: Number of unique years found

## Performance Notes

- The randomization algorithm has O(n) complexity where n is the number of questions
- Database indexes will significantly improve filter query performance
- The years API now uses an efficient database function instead of loading all records
- Pagination support allows for handling very large question databases

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing API calls will work with default parameters
- Fallback methods are provided for database functions
- Original randomization is preserved as a secondary shuffle in session creation
