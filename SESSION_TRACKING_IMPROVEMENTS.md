# Session Tracking Improvements

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Time Tracking Issue**
- **Problem**: Session tracking was not consistently using the `total_active_time` column from the database
- **Solution**: Updated all APIs to use `total_active_time` instead of `total_time_spent`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/api/user/stats/route.ts` - Now uses `total_active_time` for completed sessions and real-time calculation for active sessions
  - `app/api/user/session-history/route.ts` - Updated to use `total_active_time` consistently
  - `app/api/sessions/[sessionId]/results/route.ts` - Fixed to use `total_active_time`

### 2. **Abrupt Session Closure Protection**
- **Problem**: Sessions closed abruptly (browser close, tab close, etc.) might not save the time spent
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive window event handlers and fallback mechanisms
- **Files Modified**:
  - `components/quiz/quiz-interface.tsx` - Added `beforeunload`, `unload`, and `visibilitychange` event handlers
  - Used `navigator.sendBeacon()` for reliable data sending during browser close
  - Added automatic pause/resume on tab visibility changes

### 3. **Answer Distribution Logic Fix**
- **Problem**: Answer distribution was counting correct/incorrect answers across all sessions instead of latest answers per question
- **Solution**: Implemented proper latest answer tracking per question
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/api/user/stats/route.ts` - Now tracks latest answer per question using a Map to avoid duplicates
  - Answer distribution now represents the user's current knowledge state, not historical performance

### 4. **Code Cleanup and Stability**
- **Problem**: Redundant code and inconsistent error handling
- **Solution**: Created centralized utility functions with proper error handling
- **Files Created**:
  - `lib/session-utils.ts` - Centralized session management utilities
  - `app/api/sessions/cleanup/route.ts` - Orphaned session cleanup endpoint

## New Features

### 1. **Session Utility Functions**
- `calculateSessionMetrics()` - Centralized metric calculation
- `safelyPauseSession()` - Robust session pausing with fallbacks
- `safelyEndSession()` - Robust session ending with fallbacks
- `cleanupOrphanedSessions()` - Automatic cleanup of stale sessions
- `getSessionActiveTime()` - Accurate time calculation

### 2. **Improved Error Handling**
- All session operations now have fallback mechanisms
- Database function failures are handled gracefully
- Manual state updates as backup when database functions fail

### 3. **Orphaned Session Cleanup**
- Automatic detection and cleanup of sessions that weren't properly closed
- Runs on dashboard load to ensure data consistency
- Configurable timeout (currently 1 hour of inactivity)

### 4. **Enhanced Window Event Handling**
- `beforeunload` - Saves session state before browser close
- `unload` - Backup save mechanism
- `visibilitychange` - Pause/resume on tab switching
- `sendBeacon()` - Reliable data transmission during page unload

## Technical Improvements

### 1. **Database Function Integration**
- Proper use of PostgreSQL functions for time calculations
- Fallback to manual calculations when functions fail
- Consistent error handling across all APIs

### 2. **Real-time vs Stored Time**
- Active sessions: Use real-time calculation via `calculate_session_active_time()`
- Completed sessions: Use stored `total_active_time` for performance
- Hybrid approach ensures accuracy and performance

### 3. **Answer Tracking Improvements**
- Latest answer per question using ordered queries
- Proper handling of question status (correct/incorrect/unanswered)
- Accurate distribution calculations based on current knowledge state

### 4. **Session State Management**
- Improved pause/resume logic with state validation
- Proper session cleanup on completion
- Active session tracking in user profiles

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. **Reduced Database Calls**
- Batch operations where possible
- Efficient use of database functions
- Proper indexing on session activity queries

### 2. **Parallel Data Fetching**
- Dashboard loads multiple data sources in parallel
- Orphaned session cleanup runs concurrently
- Non-blocking error handling

### 3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
- Multiple levels of fallback for time calculations
- Graceful degradation when database functions fail
- Consistent user experience even with partial failures

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Browser Close Testing**: Test session saving on browser close, tab close, and page refresh
2. **Network Interruption**: Test behavior during network outages
3. **Long Sessions**: Test sessions running for extended periods
4. **Multiple Tabs**: Test behavior with multiple quiz tabs open
5. **Mobile Testing**: Test on mobile devices with app switching

## Monitoring

- All session operations now have proper error logging
- Failed database function calls are logged with fallback actions
- Orphaned session cleanup results are logged
- Performance metrics available for session operations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Session Recovery**: Implement session recovery for interrupted sessions
2. **Offline Support**: Add offline capability with sync when online
3. **Session Analytics**: Add detailed session analytics and insights
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics for session operation performance
5. **User Notifications**: Notify users about session state changes

This comprehensive overhaul ensures reliable session tracking, proper time management, and improved user experience even in edge cases like abrupt browser closures.
